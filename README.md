# ionDogMap README.md

## What is this?
This is a Ionic V3/ng V4 project for a near-me app for dog owners

The app has 3 main tabs
* Map
* List of places
* Settings

The places on the map is divided into one or more of the categories
* Hotel: 'ion-home',
* Restaurant: 'ion-fork',
* Shop: 'ion-ios-cart',
* Wellness: 'ion-happy',
* Park: 'ion-leaf',
* Beautysalon: 'ion-scissors',
* Hospital: 'ion-ios-medkit',
* Photographer: 'ion-camera',
* Travel: 'ion-briefcase',
* Pension: 'ion-archive',
* Contest: 'ion-trophy',
* School: 'ion-university',
* Event: 'ion-arrow-shrink'

Places are shown with an icon corresponding to its category.

Depending of what the time allows the todo list contains:
* Goto jump to place details from map
* Add gallery with for intro and help
* Replace hardcoded places with places from various APIS
(unfortunately the generated dummy data includes lots op places in the oceans and the coordinates doen not fit with their address)
* Add central DB, so ratings and perhaps new places can be stored
* Add ratings to various pages
* Add "New Place" page
* Add favorites list and store it in local DB
* Manage favorites from settings page

This app was based on a sample from [Ahmed Alparslan Ã–zdemir](https://github.com/alparslanahmed/MekanBul).  Thank you.

Uses the [Angular Leaflet Directive](https://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/) by [David Rubert](https://github.com/tombatossals).

Of course, it wouldn't exist without the fine folks from [Drifty](http://www.drifty.com) and the [Ionic Framework Team](http://ionicframework.com).

# Old README.md below ------------------

This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myTabs tabs
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myTabs` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
